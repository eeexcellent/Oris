# Oris

**Oris** is a real-time chat application I created to allow users to easily get in touch with me through my resume website. It provides a simple way for visitors to ask questions or start a conversation, making it easier for potential employers or collaborators to reach out.

_Oris_ comes from "oratio," meaning "speech" or "conversation,".
